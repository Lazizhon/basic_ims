## Basic Inventory Management System (Work in Progress)

#### Overview

​	This desktop app serves as a basic inventory management tool that allows users to perform basic CRUD operations and visualize the data entries and transactions.

​	It is developed using [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) for cross-platform desktop app experience and other frameworks such as [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Sqlite3](https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3) and [Ant Design](https://ant.design/). The boilerplate for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/amilajack/erb-sqlite-example) by [amilajack](https://github.com/amilajack).
